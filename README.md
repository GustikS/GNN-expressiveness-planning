### Learning to plan with structured neural models

This is a code repository accompanying the ICAPS'24 paper on [Expressiveness of Graph Neural Networks in Planning Domains](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pKEkSAPSGJ). 

It contains all the code needed to reproduce the experiments ([experiments.py](https://github.com/GustikS/learning2plan/blob/master/experiments.py)), but the datasets are available separately on [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FuPe1SWMC1hsNclDn-HTr9G_HFYWOxll?usp=sharing)
